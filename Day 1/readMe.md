# day 1
I learned about the following:
- Data types (such as String, Number, Boolean, undefined, Null, and Symbol)
- Checking data types using the (typeof) operator
- Commenting (both single line and multiline commenting)
- Variables and also rules a valid javascript variable should follow
- declaring variables using the (var, let and const) in which the var is not recommended as it's prone to errors
